The `sadj` package allows for relatively flexible use of the underlying
`X13-ARIMA-SEATS` program.  But results can be produced quickly and easily by
accepting default parameters.  Consider the following:

```{r simpleex}
ap <- X13Series(AirPassengers)
```

This produces an object, `ap`, of class `X13Series`.  This object is initialised
with the built-in `AirPassengers` object--a time series holding the classic Box
and Jenkins airline passengers data.  Once imported, the data is coerced into a
`data.frame` which looks as follows:

```r
head(ap, 10)
```
```{r simpleextab, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(ap, 10), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

In fact, while we provide the ability to create an `X13Series` object directly
from a `ts` object because it is a commonly used type in R, we can also
create one from a `data.frame` like the one displayed above.

An `X13Series` object has a number of attributes stored interally, such as the
adjustment specifications required by the `X13-ARIMA-SEATS` program.  For
example, the specifications are held in an attribute called `SpecList`, and can
be retrieved via `getSpecList(ap)`:

```{r simpleex.spec}
getSpecList(ap)
```

The specification is actually an R list, but it has a print method that displays
a familiar string representation.  In this case, a default, minimal
specification was provided, but there are facilities for providing different
specifications when creating `X13Series` objects, or modifying specifications
for existing objects.  The details of working with specifications are outlined
in a vignette, `vignette("specifications", package = "sadj")`.

In this simple example, no adjustment specifications were explicitly provided.
In actual fact, though, a default specification was provided, and the original
call to `X13Series` could have been written in the following equivalent way:

```r
ap1 <- X13Series(AirPassengers, type = "x11")
```

If the SEATS adjustment method is preferred over X11, then a default SEATS
adjustment is also readily available:

```{r seats01}
ap2 <- X13Series(AirPassengers, type = "seats")
getSpecList(ap2)
```

Seasonal adjustment is carried out by calling `adjust` on an adjustable object:

```{r simpleex.adjust}
ap.res <- adjust(ap)
```

The result in this case is of class `X13SeriesResult`.  It is a data frame
containing the raw series and `X13-ARIMA-SEATS` output tables such as `d10`,
`d11`, and `d12` as columns:

```r
head(ap.res, 10)
```
```{r simpleex.res, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(ap.res, 10), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

In fact, any output produced by `X13-ARIMA-SEATS` that is a time series is added
as a column to the output data frame.  The columns can vary depending on the
adjustement specification and, besides, are somewhat esoteric.  For this reason,
helper functions exist for extracting the more common components of an adjusted
series in a more uniform way.  For example, the raw, seasonally adjusted and
trend series can be accessed by calling `actual`, `seasadj`, and `trend`,
respectively.

```r
head(trend(ap.res), 10)
```
```{r simpleex.trend, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(trend(ap.res), 10), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

Output that isn't a times series is stored as an attribute.  For example, the
'`UDG`' file, if present, is a file containing a range of summary statistics and
the like, and is read in as a list and stored as an attribute called `udg`.
Many of these attributes aren't directly useful, and helper functions are
instead provided which give the appropriate access.  For example, calling
`summary` on an adjusted series will cause the HTML version of the output to
display, or else it will cause a relatively pretty tabular version of the `udg`
attribute to display:

```r
summary(ap.res, html = TRUE)
```
![`summary(ap.res)`](img/htmlout.png)

or:

```r
summary(ap.res)
```
```{r simpleex.res.summary, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary(ap.res), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

There are a range of built-in plotting functions provided to visualise the
results:

```{r simpleex.res.plot1}
plot(ap.res)
```

```{r simpleex.res.plot2}
plot(ap.res, type = "seasonal")
```
