# Basic Use (WIP)
The first thing you might want to do is run seasonal adjustment on your existing `X13-ARIMA-SEATS` file setup.  You can do this in 2 steps. 

1.) Read in the series from a `.mta` file:  

```r
my_series <- X13BatchFromMTA(mta_path)
```

2.) Seasonally adjust the series:

```r
adjusted_series <- adjust(my_series)
```

# Sadj objects (WIP)
Next, it helps to understand the basic structure of the X13 objects.  Everything is organised as lists of lists.  `my_series` is an `X13Batch` object.  `adjusted_series` is an `X13BatchResult` object.  They are broken down in the following way:  


```{r listsofliststab, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(object=c("X13Batch","X13SeriesGroup", "X13BatchResult", "X13SeriesGroupResult"),
           list_of=c("X13SeriesGroup","X13Series","X13SeriesGroupResult","X13SeriesResult"),
           comments=c("The groups are created by inserting empty lines in the .mta file between series.",
                      "There can be zero or one composite series in a group.  The composite must go at the end.",
                      "adjust produces result objects.",
                      "")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

`X13Series` is a dataframe with time series input data.  It has attributes that are accessible/mutable with the following functions:  

```{r getsettab, echo = FALSE}
data.frame(get=c("getSpecList","getSpec","getSpecParameter", "getFacFile", "getRegFile"),
           set=c("setSpecList","setSpec","setSpecParameter", "setFacFile", "setRegFile"),
           comments=c("Method gets passed to the X13SpecList object which is attached to X13Series as an attribute",
                      "Same as comment above",
                      "Same as comment above",
                      "get/set the factor file dataframe attached to the the X13Series",
                      "get/set the regression file dataframe attached to the the X13Series")) %>% 
  knitr::kable(row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```


(`adjusted_series` is an `X13BatchResult` object and has a similar breakdown.)  

If you are investigating alternate configurations of X13 files, the bulk of your work will sit between steps 1 and 2 and will use the basic functions above for interaction.  


You may want to create different scenarios from `my_series` and then make some modification to the spec, transform, and regression files. 


# Orginal Documentation


The `sadj` package allows for relatively flexible use of the underlying
`X13-ARIMA-SEATS` program.  But results can be produced quickly and easily by
accepting default parameters.  Consider the following:

```{r simpleex}
ap <- X13Series(AirPassengers)
```

This produces an object, `ap`, of class `X13Series`.  This object is initialised
with the built-in `AirPassengers` object--a time series holding the classic Box
and Jenkins airline passengers data.  Once imported, the data is coerced into a
`data.frame` which looks as follows:

```r
head(ap, 10)
```
```{r simpleextab, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(ap, 10), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

In fact, while we provide the ability to create an `X13Series` object directly
from a `ts` object because it is a commonly used type in R, we can also
create one from a `data.frame` like the one displayed above.

An `X13Series` object has a number of attributes stored interally, such as the
adjustment specifications required by the `X13-ARIMA-SEATS` program.  For
example, the specifications are held in an attribute called `SpecList`, and can
be retrieved via `getSpecList(ap)`:

```{r simpleex.spec}
getSpecList(ap)
```

The specification is actually an R list, but it has a print method that displays
a familiar string representation.  In this case, a default, minimal
specification was provided, but there are facilities for providing different
specifications when creating `X13Series` objects, or modifying specifications
for existing objects.  The details of working with specifications are outlined
in a vignette, `vignette("specifications", package = "sadj")`.

In this simple example, no adjustment specifications were explicitly provided.
In actual fact, though, a default specification was provided, and the original
call to `X13Series` could have been written in the following equivalent way:

```r
ap1 <- X13Series(AirPassengers, type = "x11")
```

If the SEATS adjustment method is preferred over X11, then a default SEATS
adjustment is also readily available:

```{r seats01}
ap2 <- X13Series(AirPassengers, type = "seats")
getSpecList(ap2)
```

Seasonal adjustment is carried out by calling `adjust` on an adjustable object:

```{r simpleex.adjust}
ap.res <- adjust(ap)
```

The result in this case is of class `X13SeriesResult`.  It is a data frame
containing the raw series and `X13-ARIMA-SEATS` output tables such as `d10`,
`d11`, and `d12` as columns:

```r
head(ap.res, 10)
```
```{r simpleex.res, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(ap.res, 10), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

In fact, any output produced by `X13-ARIMA-SEATS` that is a time series is added
as a column to the output data frame.  The columns can vary depending on the
adjustement specification and, besides, are somewhat esoteric.  For this reason,
helper functions exist for extracting the more common components of an adjusted
series in a more uniform way.  For example, the raw, seasonally adjusted and
trend series can be accessed by calling `actual`, `seasadj`, and `trend`,
respectively.

```r
head(trend(ap.res), 10)
```
```{r simpleex.trend, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(head(trend(ap.res), 10), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

Output that isn't a times series is stored as an attribute.  For example, the
'`UDG`' file, if present, is a file containing a range of summary statistics and
the like, and is read in as a list and stored as an attribute called `udg`.
Many of these attributes aren't directly useful, and helper functions are
instead provided which give the appropriate access.  For example, calling
`summary` on an adjusted series will cause the HTML version of the output to
display, or else it will cause a relatively pretty tabular version of the `udg`
attribute to display:

```r
summary(ap.res, html = TRUE)
```
![`summary(ap.res)`](img/htmlout.png)

or:

```r
summary(ap.res)
```
```{r simpleex.res.summary, echo = FALSE}
knitr::kable(summary(ap.res), row.names = FALSE, format = "markdown")
```

There are a range of built-in plotting functions provided to visualise the
results:

```{r simpleex.res.plot1}
plot(ap.res)
```

```{r simpleex.res.plot2}
plot(ap.res, type = "d10")
```
